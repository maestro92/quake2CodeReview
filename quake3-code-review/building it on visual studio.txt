In VS 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 or 2015, right-click the project, choose properties, go to the Debugging section -- there is a box for "Command Arguments".

2.	make sure u get the art assets from the your actual steam quake3 folder
	probably gonna be in "Program Files (or Program Files x86?) /Steam/steamapps/common/Quake 3 Arena/baseq3"
	move that folder to the folder is gonna be called baseq3. Move that to quake-III-Arena-master/code/
